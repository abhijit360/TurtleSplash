1) A turtle is swimming in the ocean
    - background water moving animation/ changing background which gives a sense of moving distance or use a static
    background with a distance moved display/ a swimming animation for the turtle

    -> swimming turtle animation (moving flippers) + other moving miscellaneous objects such as the ocean bed**
    -> the player can only move the turtle up or down. the player cannot move the turtle front or back **

3) upon eating seaweed/ vegetation, the hunger bar will refill slightly ( done)
4) there are different types of vegetation that fill the hunger bar by different levels.
5) the goal is to travel the furthest without dying
6) upon eating straws the health bar decreases ( not implemented )
7) upon eating a plastic bag the turtle "suffocates for a while". The turtle is unable to eat anything. ( done)
8) Instead of "rounds", the difficulty increases with distance travelled.
9) pitch the idea to google to add on their webpage so that they can raise awareness about ocean life and wellfare.
